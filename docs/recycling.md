# Recycling Info

Recycling water bottles should be a consistent and regular ritual for decreasing pollution, energy saving, and eco-friendly. As well, not all plastic is recyclable and must keep up to date to see which places accept certain plastics.

- Make sure when recycling, the water bottle is empty and that there is no liquid and/or water left - helps with pollution.
- Never put it in a bag. Rather, put it in the recycling bin directly.
- There are codes for recycling. Check which corresponds.
- Visual card and stickers to promote the benefits of recycling water bottles.
- Don't recycle water bottles with mixed materials
- Partner with recycling centers that offer compensations and/or refunds on water bottles.
