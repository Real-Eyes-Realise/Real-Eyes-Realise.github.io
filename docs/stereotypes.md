# Education about Homelessness Stereotypes

> Homeless people are lazy

> Homeless people are drug addicts

> Homeless people choose to be homeless

Let's start by getting one thing straight: the way we talk about **people** matters.

Instead of saying "homeless people", say **people experiencing homelessness**. Why? Because **homelessness is a situation**, not a personality trait. It's a **temporary and preventable crisis** that can happen to anyone.

## Stereotypes

### "People experiencing homelessness are lazy"

**Truth**: Most people experiencing homelessness are **working, studying** or deperately trying to do both. But when rent is $1,200/month and minimum wage is $16.55/hour, **do the math**. That's not laziness, that's trying to survive.

### "They must be on drugs"

**Truth**: Substance abuse is a health issue. Yes, some people experiencing homelessness struggle with addiciton, **just like people with homes do**. The difference? **No safe space**, no healthcare and no privary to deal with it.

### "They chose this"

**Truth**: Nobody chooses to sleep ouside on pavements, especially with Toronto's unpredictable weather. What people choose is to **leave abuse, avoid violence** or **escape unsafe situations**. What they often don't get to choose is **where to go next**.

Youth in particularly vulnerable and make up 20% of the individuals experiencing homelessness and 24% identify as 2SLGBTQ (despite making up only 5-10% of all youths) *pending citation*.

There is no "typical" person experiencing homelessness. Not all groups are equally impacted, some are more likely to experience homelessness.

**_1 in 2 people are one step away from experiencing homelessness, that could be YOU!_**[[1]](#1)

## What can YOU do?

- **Challenge Stereotypes**. Don't be ignorant.
- **Use the right language**. Words like "experiencing homelessness" remind us that this is a temporary and solvable.
- **Support youth shelters and community programs**. Donate, volunteer, advocate.
- **Be human**. Make eye contact. Offer kindness without judgement.

Homelessness does not define people.

**But how we treat people experiencing homelessness does define us.**
