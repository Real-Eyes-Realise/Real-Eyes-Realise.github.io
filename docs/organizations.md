Horizons for Youth is a shelter for at-risk and homeless youth between the ages of 16-24 years old in Toronto. We provide youth with the support they need to escape from the cycle of poverty and leave the streets behind.

## Our mission

To shelter, prepare and guide homeless and at-risk youth to achieve wellness and become contributing community members.

## Our vision

A sharing and growing community where everyone has a home.

# Trek For Teens

We are a charity run by youth across the country, created to raise funds and awareness for homeless youth in Canada. In 2007, a team of high school students from the Toronto area were asked to create a plan for a charity at the Camp Enterprise program run by the Rotary Club of Etobicoke. The idea of Trek For Teens was chosen and the team worked under the mentorship of the Rotary Club for the first year.

Since then, Trek For Teens has expanded to several regions and raised over $250,000 in funds and in-kind donations for local shelters. Our vision is for at-risk and homeless youth across Canada to be healthy, happy, safe and successful.
