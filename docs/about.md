# About us

We are a passionate, interdisciplinary team from York University currently enrolled in a Capstone course focused on addressing homelessness in Canada. Given just three weeks to develop an innovative project around the themes of Invisibility, Community Awareness, Needs Identification, and Homelessness, we set out to create something impactful. We chose the name *Real Eyes Realize* to reflect our central message: recognizing the often-invisible realities of homelessness. Meet our team and discover our unique areas of expertise below:

# About our project

Our project focuses on raising social awareness about homelessness. We've designed a water bottle with a unique label featuring an eye and a QR code, along with key information, that links directly to our website. We plan to distribute these bottles in high-traffic areas across the Greater Toronto Area, including workplaces, institutions, and potentially at corporate events. On a hot summer day, we know that free cold water is hard to resist. Our goal is to spark curiosity, encouraging people to scan the QR code and visit our site. There, they’ll find resources, stereotype-busting facts, and a quiz that helps them understand how close they might be to experiencing homelessness themselves. Ultimately, we want to humanize homelessness and show that we’re all in the same boat.
