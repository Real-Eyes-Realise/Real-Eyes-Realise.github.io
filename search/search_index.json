Given just three weeks to develop an innovative project around the themes of Invisibility, Community Awareness, Needs Identification, and Homelessness, we set out to create something impactful.

We've designed a water bottle with a unique label featuring an eye and a QR code, along with key information, that links directly to our website. We plan to distribute these bottles in high-traffic areas across the Greater Toronto Area, including workplaces, institutions, and potentially at corporate events. On a hot summer day, we know that free cold water is hard to resist. Our goal is to spark curiosity, encouraging people to scan the QR code and visit our site. There, they\u2019ll find resources, stereotype-busting facts, and a quiz that helps them understand how close they might be to experiencing homelessness themselves. Ultimately, we want to humanize homelessness and show that we\u2019re all in the same boat.</p>"},{"location":"future/","title":"The future of our product","text":"<p>With the advancement of technology within the decades and centuries, the future looks bright for different inventions on the rise.</p> <ul> <li>Implement good quality materials - sustainability, environmentally friendly.</li> <li>Work with health/safety to ensure it meets the standards.
